### What is Brio?
Brio is a new music search engine. It was built from our heart for all the people who are passionate about music and want to find out more about what they're listening. Brio contains the biggest database of music information on the web with entries being added manually and improved by the community.

### How does it work?
You look up a song, and Brio will find your song for you and it will tell you everything there is to know about it. It's simple and if you don't find a song you can add the information yourself.

### What's the catch?
No catch! We made this website because we love music and we always found ourselves willing to learn more about the songs we listen to every day. We wanted to fix that, and so Brio was made. We will never charge anyone for using the service, but donations are welcome!

### I want to help
Awesome. Brio is completely open-source so the community pretty much shapes it, but it is currently run by two developers. You can help in two ways:

* Edit or add song entries - This is straightforward. Simply search for a song and if it's not there, then feel free to add it. Once you add it you'll see your changes live on the site.
* Fork us on GitHub - For the tech-savvy out there, you are welome to fork us on GitHub and make any changes you want. We welcome any contributions!
