                    So we're going to change that. Introducing Brio: a modern open-source music search engine
                    which offers you everything there is to know about a particular song. We're constantly
                    adding new songs in collaboration with our users, and we're constantly improving. By using
                    our algorithm you'll find out more than just a few minor details. Brio offers you everything
                    at your feet.

                <p>
                    We currently maintain a very large music database to which we add entries manually. The community has
                    a very large contribution to this and we encourage everyone to add entries where they are due. We're
                    still expanding with dozens of new songs added to the database every day.
