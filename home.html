                    <p>
                        "Imagine" is a song written and performed by the English musician John Lennon. The best-selling single of his solo career, 
                        its lyrics encourage the listener to imagine a world at peace without the barriers of borders or the divisiveness of religions 
                        and nationalities, and to consider the possibility that the focus of humanity should be living a life unattached to material possessions.
                        Lennon and Yoko Ono co-produced the song and album of the same name with Phil Spector. Recording began at Lennon's home studio 
                        at Tittenhurst Park, England, in May 1971, with final overdubs taking place at the Record Plant, in New York City, during July. 
                        One month after the September release of the LP, Lennon released "Imagine" as a single in the United States; the song peaked at 
                        number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and the LP reached number one on the UK chart in November, later becoming the most commercially 
                        successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career. Although not originally released as a single in the United Kingdom, 
                        it was released in 1975 to promote a compilation LP and it reached number six in the chart that year. The song has since sold more 
                        than 1.6 million copies in the UK; it reached number one following Lennon's death in December 1980.
